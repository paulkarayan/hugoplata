The Lee Bros cook book is one of the best things that came out of 4 years of life in North Carolina.
https://www.amazon.com/Lee-Bros-Southern-Cookbook-Southerners/dp/039305781X

The authors are so enamoured with the culinary feats of the south - and elevating them - that you can't help but want to plow through as many of the recipes as you can.

I made the star anise boiled peanuts in the instant pot today. So far they have this incredible, broad bean taste - just completely changes how i think about the crop. Peanuts are legumes, after all!

Note that the raw peanuts required for this recipe play nicely with Salsa Macha!
