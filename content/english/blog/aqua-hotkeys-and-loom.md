# Linking Aqua trascripts to other programs with hotkeys 

I really like using Aqua (https://withaqua.com), & of course I have added some hotkeys.
I've shown Keyboard Maestro's use to automate tasks, but here I'll demonstrate shifting between browsers, transcribing spoken text, and converting text into a list format to show how I can really scream.

Steps to Reproduce:

0. Open VS Code because text is life.

1. Use the hotkey Command + comma to switch to the secondary browser (Chrome Canary). 
Usually this is in my secondary vertical monitor to my right. Because you care.

2. Press Command + period to activate Aqua and start transcription.

3. Press option + forward slash to copy and paste the transcribed content into the prior program (VS Code)

# A Video surprise - Loom generates Linear Ticket contents

I prepared a video for you with Loom, and then discovered that it generates Linear Tickets (???) with the new AI functionality.

Here's what you're seeing in pictures:
