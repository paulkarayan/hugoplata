Nothing has made me better at concertina than video recording myself and watching every painful bit.

For months I've been uploading them as unlisted or private. Partially because I'm embarrassed about not being good at something new. Which, when you say it out loud, is ridiculous. If I wasn't bad at it, there'd be nothing to learn.

So I'm putting it all out there. What have I got to lose?

These videos are the best of what's bad. I'm doing multiple takes and posting the least terrible one. But going back through six months of footage, I'm actually proud of the work I've put in. And I'm grateful for my teachers for giving me the gift of music again.
