Please enjoy my PyOhio talk on slaying software zombies! 

I'm talking about a very real problem of dealing with metacode (tests, docs, bugs, requirements etc...) that are no longer completely accurate (thus, zombies) due to not being in sync with the product & its code updating. 

AI, particularly LLMs, provide some interesting mechanisms to address keeping said zombies at bay.
