*Cold Mountain is all white clouds*  
*Quiet and free of dust*  
*A grassy spot makes a mountain home*  
*The bright moon its lone lamp*  
*A stone couch above a jade pool*  
*Tigers and deer for neighbors*  
*I love the joys of solitude*  
*Remaining a person beyond.*

Han Shan got it right centuries ago. He fled to Cold Mountain, made friends with deer, used the moon as his lamp. "Remaining a person beyond."
Not abandoning ones humanity, but transcending it. By stepping outside the game everyone else insists you play.

The hot takes. The manufactured urgency of every news cycle, and the soul crushing exhaustion of outrage.
We've built a civilization that profits from your distraction, then sells you mindfulness apps to cope with it.

Peter Thiel once talked about focusing on the utopian, the truly ambitious. Before he got caught up in the same political theatre he warned against, of course. That's the thing about the game - it's designed to catch everyone eventually.

Han Shan's "beyond" isn't about achievement or optimization. It's simpler and more radical.
Stop refreshing. Stop reacting. Stop letting other people's "political emergencies" become your dopamine hits.

The "joys of solitude" aren't about loneliness or misanthropy. They're about finding completeness in simplicity, discovering that when you strip away all the external definitions and distractions, there's a profound freedom and joy in just being present.

The real control isn't managing the chaos better. It's recognizing you don't need to manage anything at all;
you can walk away from the arena entirely to make a stone couch your furniture and let tigers be your neighbors.

Han Shan's mountain's still there, 1,400 years later.
The moon still works as a lamp.
