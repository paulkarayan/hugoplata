# When Your Quote Collection Looks Like a Junk Drawer

You know that feeling when you open your kitchen junk drawer and find three different types of batteries, mystery keys, and rubber bands from 2012? That's what my quote collection looked like after years of copy-pasting wisdom from books, blogs, and late-night wikipedia binges. Some quotes had fancy curly quotes, others used markdown headers, and attribution was all over the place — like business plans written on cocktail napkins.

This chaos wasn't just aesthetic. When you're trying to build a [quote-of-the-day system](https://paulkarayan.com/blog/build-your-own-quote-of-the-day/), inconsistent formatting breaks _everything_. Scripts choke on mixed markdown, searches fail because attribution isn't standardized, and good luck trying to parse quotes when half use em-dashes and the other half use double hyphens.

So I fired up Claude Code and let it loose on my 1300+ lines of collected wisdom across 6 files. The transformation was beautiful. Take this perfectly apt zen quote about mental house cleaning:

```
You should have a general house cleaning of your mind. You must take everything out of your room and clean it thoroughly. 
If it is necessary, you may bring everything back in again. You may want many things, so one by one you can bring them back in. But if they are not necessary, there is no need to keep them.
```

Claude Code turned that jumbled text into a clean, parseable format:

Now these standardized quotes slot perfectly back into my quote-of-the-day pipeline. No more debugging at 6am because a smart quote murdered my JSON parser.

The best part? My test plan is the quote system itself. Since it's randomly sampling quotes, I QA the formatting by getting one delivered daily. If a quote breaks the parser, I'll know tomorrow morning with my coffee. It's continuous integration for wisdom — automated enlightenment testing.


## A call to arms

If you're sitting on years of collected text — quotes, notes, recipes, whatever — and the formatting chaos is preventing you from building something cool with it, fire up Claude Code. The cleanup might be easier than you think, and the possibilities that open up afterward are worth it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go clean out my actual junk drawer. The quotes are organized, but I still can't find a working pen
