My PyBay 2024 talk in San Francisco posted on Youtube here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6dcodNxEr0&list=PL85KuAjbN_gvx5b_BgLVcKfccnlZAVPMk&index=9

In this talk, we'll explore how AI being the ""bright shiny object"" as a bridge to bring both technical and non-technical employees into the world of coding. By leveraging AI tools and methodologies, we'll demonstrate how to demystify programming concepts and make them accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

This comes from experience at our company, Opto Investments, as a professional engineer (PK) and an investment analyst who's a hobbyist pythonista (Manny). 

We'll cover:
* Engagement Strategies: Techniques for demystifying tech and getting through to that inner creativity that we know everyone has

* Lesson Plans and Case Studies we used to personalise the learning experience for individuals with different skill levels.

* Real-World Applications: Practical examples of how AI can be used in everyday tasks to highlight the relevance and importance of coding.
