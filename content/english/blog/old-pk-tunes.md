# Electronic music I produced that is now a decade old

Yeah, so in my fervour around MIDI instrument creation, I was reminded that I haven't published a song in over 10 years.

It's been fun to go back and listen to them. They're not all that good, but I'm still stoked to have made them even - though they could have been so much better!
Among other things, I didn't understand how to use compression very well and haven't been inspired to go back and fix or do better mixing.

My set of tools:
- FL Studio
- Audacity
- a MIDI keyboard for sketching
- going to these sketchy as f!ck sites to get acapellas

Please enjoy this little time capsule from [The Known Lands](https://soundcloud.com/the_known_lands)!


## This simple sweet dragon

This takes a rather long sample from a [James Yuill song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPkfFv_aJsA) and
mixes in a bunch simple ideas I had floating around into a tune

## The dangerous knife game

This is a mashup of The Knife's ["Heartbeats"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPD8Ja64mRU) & The Game ["Wouldn't Get Far"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlzrC-B6n-M) ft. Kanye West... fun fact, I hadn't heard the original The Game song until today. I just found the acapella!
