Great video by Josh Saunders about learning grappling:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvsLAqWKVQo

This is bigger than grappling, or rather as the quote suggests - learning to live resembles learning to grapple an awful lot!

Two things that really clicked with me:

1. Itâ€™s all about how you battle with your own perceived level of progress.

In any skill, divorce your level of with the happiness attained by that progress, and realise that getting good at something over a long period of time is actually going to quite mundane.

2. Successful people do ordinary things for an inordinate amount of time.  

This appears to be a paraphrase of quotes attributed to a number of people, but it's damned good.
