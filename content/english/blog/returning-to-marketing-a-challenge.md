# A Practical Challenge - Marketing Myself

I mentioned in a prior post that I started my tech career in growth marketing, and still advise clients from time to time here.
It's still surprising to me that marketers still have to put up with the sort of thing that got me to change careers, namely that
they are still saddled with so many manual processes and a patchwork of mismatched tools that are held together with Zapier-duct tape.

I mentioned some grand ideas about how to tackle this holistically, but interestingly enough I have found a personally relevant playground
to try some of these ideas out: the opportunity to grow my brand.

As an engineering leader at Opto Investments, I have been trying to speak at more conferences, and have more of a digital presence
with blogging (here and linkedin). But when I put my marketing hat back on, I start to wonder about what channels are working. 
What is reaching people and/or resonating with them? How do I measure success of a branding exercise?

All awesome questions!


# The Proof of the Pudding...

So here's my challenge for 2025: develop and share what I try (and what works) to build my brand with you!

Perhaps this will include:
- Reviews of point solutions and workflows
- Tools I build to solve challenges
- Check-ins on my actual growth / goals
- Content that I've found useful

To set starting context, I'm primarily going to use LinkedIn as a target. We'll see how that goes?

Wish me luck!
