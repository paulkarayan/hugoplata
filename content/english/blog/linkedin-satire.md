```
these marketing demons use an artillery of buzzwords to shield themselves from the truth that they
don't know how to do their jobs properly - frankie

I have been posting a lot more on LinkedIn and that's given me an amusing look into the kinds
of ~drivel~ erm posts that people make. 

This is a great video that somewhat sums up my feelings:

Frankie describes the two-step formula:

1. going to painstaking detail about a small mistake they made
2. shoehorn a moral lesson into it telling us all what it taught them about something vague such as authenticity, 
accountability or resilience.

example: I ran a half marathon in the rain with a sprained ankle. here's what it taught me about consistency

# satire ahead

I wrote a program to generate LinkedIn satirical content which i will post every thursday.
Because i'm a thought leader, because "it'd be too taboo to come out as a narcissist".

here's an example:

Title: What a Broken Toaster Taught Me About Leadership

Last weekend, my toaster broke. Not dramatically—no sparks or smoke—just a quiet refusal to toast. At first, I was frustrated. How hard is it to heat bread? But as I stood there, holding a cold slice of sourdough, I realized this wasn’t just about breakfast. It was about life.

You see, the toaster wasn’t failing me. It was inviting me to reflect on resilience.

I could’ve given up and settled for untoasted bread. But leaders don’t settle. Instead, I did what any visionary would do: I pressed the lever down again. And again. And again. Each failure taught me something new. Patience. Creativity. The importance of staying calm under pressure.

Eventually, I achieved success—not because the toaster worked (it didn’t) but because I adapted. I discovered the broil setting on my oven. And in that moment, I understood something profound: true leadership isn’t about having the perfect tools. It’s about finding solutions when the tools let you down.

So, whether you’re managing a team, tackling a big project, or just trying to make breakfast, remember this: the broken toaster moments are where growth happens.
