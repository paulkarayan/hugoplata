After leaving my last startup gig at Opto, I got a text from two of my former colleagues - fun people who share econ videos and questions back and forth. It was a link to a YouTube video breaking down economic principles I didn't even think to consider - namely, the hypothesis that "Money Did Not Come From Barter - It Came From Blood Feuds". See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-D5FERQzU4

It goes to show: The real value of working at a startup goes way beyond the paycheck. It's the network and learning you gain that pays dividends for life.

## You're Surrounded by Diverse Insights
At a startup, you're not just siloed in your domain. You're elbow to elbow with absurdly smart people across disciplines. In my case, I got to learn econ and business strategy just by osmosis. Working alongside the two folks on the group text - a co-founder with an epic economics background and a brilliant engineer with great questions - I couldn't help but get excited about macroeconomics and (also) pick something up.

The amount of knowledge I absorbed outside my core engineering skills was mind-blowing. And it made me a better, more well-rounded builder.

## Your Network Lasts a Lifetime
But here's the kicker: That network and those learning opportunities don't end when you leave. The brilliant folks you met become lifelong resources - people you can tap for esoteric knowledge or a gut check when you need it most.

Having that trust and shared experience means you've always got a group of reliable people a text away, even years later. That's priceless.

## Always Be Learning
So if you're an engineer or avid learner, consider joining a startup. Not just for the potential financial upside, but for the invaluable network and learning you'll carry with you forever.

It's the ultimate cheat code for accelerating your growth and setting yourself up for a lifetime of building awesome shit. Don't sleep on it.
