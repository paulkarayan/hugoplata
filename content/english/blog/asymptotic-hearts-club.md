Started posting some of my music a while back. Thought it belongs here.
While the band name is poking a bit of fun at midwest emo, the stated goal is:

Taking anglo concertina and button accordion where it doesn't belong.

What that means entirely? I don't know yet. Finding out as we speak. Hope you enjoy!
