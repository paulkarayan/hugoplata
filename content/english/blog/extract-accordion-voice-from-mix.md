# update

This is an even better version using Moises' more expensive tier for
a lovely Horace Trahan tune:

# original

So much of learning the cajun accordion is by ear, so I wondered if there was a good way to just
extract that sweet Zydeco accordion sound from a mix or song? Turns out there is. There are
a decent number of tools, including Spleeter, Splitter.ai, PhonicMind, Samplab and others that
I tried to pull this single voice (or "stem") out... but I had the most luck with Moises and
LaLa.ai.

For Moises, I use the $5.99/mo pro plan and select the "Wind, vocals, drums, bass, other" 
extraction. Then, I just use Wind.

For LaLa - i do wind extraction.

This happens to work on the quality of file I get when I extract from Youtube videos using 
ezmp3.cc. Let's see an example here where we take from the [original song - "Beau Jocque Boogie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKi8Nlvqy4M):

Though the usual trick i use to screen record using quicktime and pull the UI sounds (which 
is `brew install --cask background-music`) doesn't work with Moises which is actually the best
one!
